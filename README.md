## Fireworks Particle System Demo v2\.0


</div>

### Description

This is an update of a previous work (which seemed to dissapear from PSC when I tried to edit the entry, so I'll delete my previous entry if it shows up again). This application is a demonstration of a particle system designed to create fireworks, although it can easily be adapted to other things. It includes attributes for position, velocity, color, and aging for each particle in the system. This is a preliminary demo, and I will soon update its framework and use DirectX for the drawing. Comments are always appreciated, so that I can see what needs tweaking.
